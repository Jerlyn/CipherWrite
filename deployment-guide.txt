## Fix for ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND Errors

The errors you're seeing are because the browser is trying to load files that don't exist yet. Here's how to fix them:

### 1. Create the Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p js
```

### 2. Place Files in the Correct Locations

1. Save the HTML code to `index.html` in the root directory
2. Save the CSS code to `styles.css` in the root directory
3. Save the detector.js code to `js/detector.js`
4. Save the app.js code to `js/app.js`

### 3. Create a Favicon

Option 1: Convert the SVG to ICO
- Use an online converter like https://convertio.co/svg-ico/
- Upload the SVG we created
- Download the .ico file and save it as `favicon.ico` in the root directory

Option 2: Use a Data URL in HTML
- Replace the favicon link in index.html with:
```html
<link rel="icon" href="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 64 64%22><circle cx=%2232%22 cy=%2232%22 r=%2230%22 fill=%22%232563eb%22 /><circle cx=%2226%22 cy=%2226%22 r=%2212%22 fill=%22none%22 stroke=%22white%22 stroke-width=%224%22 /><line x1=%2234%22 y1=%2234%22 x2=%2246%22 y2=%2246%22 stroke=%22white%22 stroke-width=%224%22 stroke-linecap=%22round%22 /></svg>" type="image/svg+xml">
```

## GitHub Deployment

### 1. Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/ai-text-detective

# Initialize a new git repository
git init

# Add all files to the repository
git add .

# Make the initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit of AI Text Detective"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub and sign in with your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Name the repository "ai-text-detective"
4. Keep it public or private based on your preference
5. Do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 3. Connect and Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Jerlyn/ai-text-detective.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
# Note: If your default branch is named "master" use:
# git push -u origin master
```

### 4. Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings"
3. Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" section
4. Select "main" (or "master") branch as the source
5. Click "Save"
6. Your site will be published at https://jerlyn.github.io/ai-text-detective/

## Testing the Application

Open the index.html file in your browser. You should no longer see the ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND errors.

To test the AI detection functionality:
1. Paste some text in the text area
2. Click "Analyze"
3. Review the results

Try with both human-written and AI-generated text to see how accurately it detects the difference.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter file not found errors:

1. Check file paths: Make sure all files are in the correct directories
2. Check file names: Ensure all filenames match exactly what's referenced in the HTML
3. Check browser cache: Try clearing your browser cache or opening in a private/incognito window
4. Check file permissions: Ensure your web server has permission to access these files
5. Check for typos: Ensure there are no typos in the file paths in the HTML
