# CipherWrite Implementation Guide

Follow these steps to transform your AI Text Detective into CipherWrite with all the new features:

## 1. Update the HTML

Replace your existing `index.html` file with the new version provided in the "Updated index.html with new name and tagline" artifact. This includes:

- Changing the name to "CipherWrite"
- Updating the tagline to "Uncover the True Author"
- Adding the new sections for improvement suggestions
- Adding the FAQ section
- Updating various text elements for clarity

## 2. Update the CSS

There are two ways to implement the CSS changes:

### Option 1: Add to existing CSS
Copy the contents from the "CSS Updates for Enhanced Features" artifact and add them to the end of your existing `styles.css` file.

### Option 2: Replace CSS file
If you've made minimal customizations to the original CSS, you might prefer to replace it entirely with the combined version.

## 3. Update JavaScript

Replace your existing `app.js` file with the new version provided in the "Updated app.js with Improvement Suggestions" artifact. This includes:

- Implementing the character count progress bar
- Adding drag-and-drop functionality
- Adding tooltip information
- Implementing improvement suggestions
- Enhancing visual feedback for results
- Updating the copy functionality to include suggestions

## 4. Update the detector.js file

Keep using the optimized detector.js file we provided earlier that fixed the Chrome compatibility issues. The app.js changes are designed to work with this version.
